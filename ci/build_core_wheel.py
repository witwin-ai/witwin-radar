"""Build the locked Core wheel that the radar smokes install beside the radar one.

``ci/wheel_smoke.py`` and ``ci/coexistence_smoke.py`` both install into an
isolated ``pip install --target`` with ``--no-deps``, so without Core in the
same target ``import witwin.core`` - which ``witwin.radar`` performs at package
import - resolves to whatever the ambient environment has, or to nothing. That
is why ``--core-wheel`` is required, and this script is what satisfies it in a
tier run.

The near-identical file in the Channel repository is deliberate rather than
shared: the two distributions have separate CI, separate checkouts, and no
common package that either could import at gate time. A shared copy would need
an owner that neither repository has.

Core lives outside this repository, so its checkout is resolved EXPLICITLY and
fails loudly. ``WITWIN_CORE_SOURCE_DIR`` is authoritative when set - an invalid
explicit path is an error and never falls back. Without it, exactly two layouts
are tried, both of which are how this repository is actually checked out:

* ``<repo>/../core`` - the sibling layout the release workflow creates when it
  checks Core out next to Channel;
* ``<repo>/../../core`` - the monorepo layout, which is also what a
  ``.worktrees/<name>`` worktree sees.

A candidate counts only if it is a directory whose ``pyproject.toml`` declares
``name = "witwin"``. Nothing else is searched: no ``CONDA_PREFIX``, no
site-packages, no CMake registry, no installed distribution. A wheel built from
an unidentified directory would be a worse input than no wheel at all.
